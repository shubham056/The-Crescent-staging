              The Crescent has been awarded LEED Silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) under the Existing Buildings rating system. With a current score of 81, The Crescent has been an Energy Star labeled building since 2008. Factors such as building automation systems, lighting controls, and chilled water thermal storage have contributed to a significant decrease in overall energy consumption. The replacement of all water closets with water-conserving, low-flow models, coupled with the implementation of comprehensive green cleaning and recycling programs, are just a few examples of The Crescent’s leadership in sustainability practices.
              </p>
              <p>
              The Crescent® is focused on providing a green building environment for our customers to demonstrate our commitment to becoming better stewards of the environment within the commercial real estate market.
